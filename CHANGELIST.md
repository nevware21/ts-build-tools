## ChangeLog

Initial release of all CLI tools as separate packages, this initial release is to primarily support the release process for the @nevware21 projects.

To date these tools have existed within the individual repo's ( [`@nevware21/ts-utils`](https://github.com/nevware21/ts-utils); [`@nevware21/ts-async`](https://github.com/nevware21/ts-utils); [`@nevware21/grunt-plugins`](https://github.com/nevware21/grunt-plugins); and [`@nevware21/tripwire`](https://github.com/nevware21/tripwire) ) is various forms and mostly the same set of features. As individually released projects the code has been refactored to be more generic while still providing the same functionality. Moving forward these tools will be extended as required, including any community requests.
